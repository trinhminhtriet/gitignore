## ‚ú® Features

- Create `.gitignore` files for specific languages or frameworks.
- List all available templates.

## üöÄ Installation

Binaries for all major platforms are available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/trinhminhtriet/gitignore/releases).

### Manually

You'll need Go for this. You can grab it over at http://golang.org/.

```sh
go get github.com/trinhminhtriet/gitignore
go install github.com/trinhminhtriet/gitignore
```

## üí° Usage

To create a `.gitignore` file for specific languages or frameworks, use the `gitignore create` command followed by the names of the templates you want to include. For example, to create a `.gitignore` file for Go, Java, and Ruby, you would run:

```sh
gitignore create go java ruby
```

This will generate a `.gitignore` file with the appropriate rules for those languages.

To see a list of all available templates, use the `gitignore list` command:

```sh
gitignore list
```
